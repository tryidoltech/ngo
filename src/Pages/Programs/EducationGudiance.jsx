              The situation of people in our country is really poor. For
              centuries, in the name of religion and socio-cultural people,
              women have been deliberately denied growth opportunities in the
              country. The girls are expected to help around the house in rural
              areas and the majority of the families are poor, which makes it
              difficult to provide education for all their children. Because of
              this, girls are kept for housework.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
              On the other hand, due to Covid-19 lockdown, many poor families
              lost their livelihood and it has become difficult to live a
              quality life. Many of them were earlier employed in various
              Construction sites, factories, retail market, farming, security
              guard, Gardner, Housekeeping, catering, taxi, auto driver etc.
