            In India 37.1% of the youth are in the labour force, while the
            participation rate of men is 57.1% women have only 12.7%. 3 out of
            every 4 women in India do not take part in any recognized economic
            activity. Raising women participation in the workforce can boost
            Indiaâ€™s GDP by 27 per cent.

              discussions so that the girls are able to learn directly from them

              in the village to create awareness related to women and the
              village people. We also provide a platform for girls to learn and
              develop their skills during the week.
